# Making-Science-Sweeft
I tried my best to made those apis but some parts of the task is not completed. I struggled with making new database tables for different users. It was crusial part for me and thats where I got stuck. I also used JWT token but culdn't figure out how to use them. Every time user logs in it returns the token but its completely useless. I couldn't reach to the CRUD function which is not that hard but since I couldn't managed to create new tables for users, there was no need for those. 
I used Flask as framework and SQLite as databases. I was testing api's with PostMan and sending the information with raw, json. Every api is returning json and response number. 

this is how registration was working
